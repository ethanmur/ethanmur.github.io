Hello! I am a postdoctoral resesarcher working at NOAA's [Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/) and the [University of Miami](http://earth.miami.edu/). I am currently studying the physics of tropical convection to better understand severe weather systems like hurricanes.

I completed my PhD in July 2025 at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/) studying the structure and impacts of North Atlantic tropical cyclones. I recieved a BA in physics with a minor in computer science from [Vassar College](https://www.vassar.edu/) in May 2021.

My [current research](/current-research) compares detailed measurements from NOAA's Hurricane Hunter Aircraft to tropical cyclone models. I have a broad range of academic and personal interests which I explore through [smaller projects](/blog). In my free time, I like to explore Colorado and take [photos](/photography) with my friends.
