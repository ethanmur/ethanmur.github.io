Hello! I am currently a PhD student at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/) studying the structure and impacts of North Atlantic tropical cyclones. I expect to graduate in July 2025. I recieved a BA in physics with a minor in computer science from [Vassar College](https://www.vassar.edu/) in May 2021.

My [current research](/current-research) compares detailed measurements from NOAA's Hurricane Hunter Aircraft to tropical cyclone models. I have a broad range of academic and personal interests which I explore through [smaller projects](/blog). In my free time, I like to explore Colorado and take [photos](/photography) with my friends.
